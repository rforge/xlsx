NEWS for package xlsx

Changes in version 0.1.2

 o Fixed getRows, getCells so it does not error out for empty
 rows/cells.  Modified read.xlsx too.  Should write a UNIT TEST!

 o Added append argument to write.xlsx to be able to export to
 multiple worksheets of a file.  (Suggestion by rlearnr@gmail.com.)
